OK.\nphd f: Yes.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: For you it is.\nprofessor c: Yeah. We uh we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too not too hot, not too cold, they were you know, they were uh, far enough away that you got more background noise, uh, and uh and so forth\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the you know, the really good No, th\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: they I mean they didn't Wait a minute. I 'm saying that wrong. They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference. So it was no didn't seem to be a good point to them. On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice, precisely because it's in the middle.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: There's uh, some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh, little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel, but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh, getting rid of lapels.\nphd a: The mike number is \nprofessor c: So,\nphd f: Uh, your mike number's written on the back of that unit there.\nphd a: Oh yeah. One.\nphd f: And then the channel number's usually one less than that.\nphd a: Oh, OK. OK.\nphd f: It - it's one less than what's written on the back of your \nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd f: yeah. So you should be zero, actually.\nphd a: Hello? Yeah.\nphd f: For your uh, channel number.\nphd a: Yep, yep.\nprofessor c: And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations. no, they don't don't have a have any Indian pronunciations.\nphd f: So what we usually do is um, we typically will have our meetings\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits. Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the the bottom of their forms.\nprofessor c: Session R\nphd d: R - nineteen?\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: R - nineteen.\nphd f: Yeah. We 're This is session R - nineteen.\nprofessor c: If you say so. O K. Do we have anything like an agenda? What's going on? Um. I guess um. So. One thing \nphd f: Sunil's here for the summer?\nprofessor c: Sunil's here for the summer, right. Um, so, one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh, and then just uh, I guess uh, progress reports individually, and then uh, plans for where we go between now and then, pretty much. Um.\nphd f: I could say a few words about um, some of the uh, compute stuff that's happening around here, so that people in the group know.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. OK. Why don't you start with that? That's sort of \nphd f: OK.\nprofessor c: Yeah?\nphd f: We um So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines, uh, to use as sort of a compute farm. And um, uh, we ordered uh, SUN - Blade - one - hundreds, and um, I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in, but, uh, in addition, we 're running So the plan for using these is, uh, we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh, fixed up and up to speed. And he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um, run things using P - make and Customs. You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that. The simplest thing And I can send an email around or, maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something. Um,\nprofessor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ,\nphd f: there's a c\nprofessor c: you know what I 'm saying?\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: so that you can Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, there's a command, uh, that you can use called \" run command \". \" Run dash command \", \" run hyphen command \". And, if you say that and then some job that you want to execute, uh, it will find the fastest currently available machine, and export your job to that machine, and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment. So you can try this as a simple test with uh, the L S command. So you can say \" run dash command L S \", and, um, it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute, and um, do an LS on your current directory. So, substitute LS for whatever command you want to run, and um And that's a simple way to get started using using this. And, so, soon, when we get all the new machines up, um, e then we 'll have lots more compute to use. Now th one of the nice things is that uh, each machine that's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it. Uh, attributes like how much memory the machine has, what its speed is, what its operating system, and when you use something like \" run command \", you can specify those attributes for your program. For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux, you can give it the Linux attribute, and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that. So. You can control where your jobs go, to a certain extent, all the way down to an individual machine. Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself. So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that. If there's already a job running, on some machine that you 're trying to select, your job will get queued up, and then when that resource, that machine becomes available, your job will get exported there. So, there's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh, right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're Uh. The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it.\nprofessor c: So as I understand, you know, he's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines,\nphd f: So.\nprofessor c: is the rough division of \nphd f: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, you know, I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and uh, uh I fired off a training job, and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying, \" uh, are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run. \" So I had to back off a little bit. But, soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available. So, um, that's just a quick update about what we 've got. So.\ngrad g: Um, I have I have a question about the uh, parallelization?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So, um, let's say I have like, a thousand little little jobs to do?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um, how do I do it with \" run command \"? I mean do \nphd f: You could write a script uh, which called run command on each sub - job\ngrad g: Uh - huh. A thousand times?\nphd f: right? But you probably wanna be careful with that\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: because um, you don't wanna saturate the network. Uh, so, um, you know, you should you should probably not run more than, say ten jobs yourself at any one time, uh, just because then it would keep other people \ngrad g: Oh, too much file transfer and stuff.\nphd f: Well it's not that so much as that, you know, e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and, you know, people's jobs would get delayed, so it's sort of a sharing thing. Um,\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time. Um. So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run, um, you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \", uh, to only have ten of those going at a time. And uh, then, when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one. Um,\nprofessor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop, I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine.\nphd f: Yeah. Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful.\nprofessor c: as I recall, but. Yeah.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd f: Um, but uh, you can also If you have that level of parallelization um, and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that, you can use um, P - make\ngrad g: Just do P - make.\nphd f: and and you basically write a Make file that uh, you know your final job depends on these one thousand things,\ngrad g: s Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and when you run P - make, uh, on your Make file, you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and that number represents how many uh, machines to use at once. And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd f: So,\ngrad g: Right. OK.\nphd f: I can get some documentation.\nphd d: So it it's it's not systematically queued. I mean all the jobs are running. If you launch twenty jobs, they are all running. Alright.\nphd f: It depends. If you \" Run command \", that I mentioned before, is doesn't know about other things that you might be running.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nphd f: So, it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once,\nphd d: Right.\nphd f: and they wouldn't know about each other. But if you use P - make, then, it knows about all the jobs that it has to run\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and it can control, uh, how many it runs simultaneously.\nprofessor c: So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make, or?\nphd f: It uses \" export \" underlyingly. But, if you i It's meant to be run one job at a time? So you could fire off a thousand of those, and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running.\nprofessor c: So why would one use that rather than P - make?\nphd f: Well, if you have, um Like, for example, uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a, uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh, six hours to run, and somebody's using, uh, the machine you typically use, you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine, the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there.\nprofessor c: Now, does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make, which is that, you know, if you run something on somebody's machine and they come in and hit a key then it \nphd f: Yes. Yeah, there are um Right. So some of the machines at the institute, um, have this attribute called \" no evict \". And if you specify that, in in one of your attribute lines, then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: But, the machines that don't have that attribute, if a job gets fired up on that, which could be somebody's desktop machine, and and they were at lunch,\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console, then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine. Automatically. So which can cause you to lose time, right? If you had a two hour job, and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted. So. If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted, then you give it the minus the attribute, you know, \" no evict \", and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from. So.\nprofessor c: Um, what what about I remember always used to be an issue, maybe it's not anymore, that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work, but if you were logged into it from home?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and you weren't hitting any keys? cuz you were, home?\nphd f: Yeah, I I 'm not sure how that works.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, it seems like Andreas did something for that.\nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd f: Um.\nprofessor c: OK. We can ask him sometime.\nphd f: But Yeah. I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY, so maybe if you echoed something to the you know, dev dev console or something.\nprofessor c: You probably wouldn't ordinarily, though. Yeah. Right? You probably wouldn't ordinarily.\nphd f: Hmm?\nprofessor c: I mean you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in, and it takes forever to even log you in, and you probably go, \" screw this \",\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: and You know.\nphd f: Yeah. Yeah, so, um,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: yeah. I I can I 'm not sure about that one.\nprofessor c: yeah.\nphd f: But uh.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: Uh, I need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions\nphd f: OK.\nphd a: So, I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting.\nphd f: Um. Yeah. Yeah, and and also uh, Stephane's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. OK, sure\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd f: Especially with regard to the Aurora stuff.\nphd a: OK.\nphd f: He he knows that stuff better than I do.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, why don't we uh, uh, Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet, why don't yo you tell us what's what's up with you? Wh - what you 've been up to, hopefully.\nphd a: Um. Yeah. So, uh, shall I start from Well I don't know how may I how OK. Uh, I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh, yeah, after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system, what they submitted, because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours. So So I tried uh, And u First I tried just LDA. And then I found that uh, I mean, if if I combine it with LDA, it gives @ @ improvement over theirs. Uh \nphd f: Are y are you saying LDA?\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd f: LDA. OK.\nphd a: So, just just the LDA filters. I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that. But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: What I did was I took the LDA filter's design using clean speech, uh, mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so, instead of using this, uh, narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh, I got new filters. So that seems to be giving uh, improving over their uh, system. Slightly. But, not very significantly. And uh, that was uh, showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA. And uh, so then after after that I I added uh, on - line normalization also on top of that. And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech, and whatever we try it on with proposal - one. But um, I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot, I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value I mean, I have to increase the time constant, or reduce the value of the update value. That's all I found So I have to. Uh, Yeah. And uh, uh, the other other thing what I tried was, I just um, uh, took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information, just the Aurora baseline, to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the I mean the w speech and nonspeech. And uh, I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh.\nprofessor c: Uh, can you back up a second, I I I missed something, uh, I guess my mind wandered. Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth, uh, uh things got better again?\nphd a: Yeah. No.\nprofessor c: or is it?\nphd a: No. No, things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used.\nprofessor c: Did it not? No, no. With a different time constant.\nphd a: With the different time constant I found that I mean, I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization,\nprofessor c: Oh.\nphd a: because I I found that I would have change the value of the update factor.\nprofessor c: No you didn't, OK.\nphd a: But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: So, it's still not \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: I mean, the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: And uh, so,\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: oh yeah So I just stopped there with the uh, speech enhancement. The the other thing what I tried was the adding the uh, endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech. And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information, I just, uh, use \nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd f: So people won't even have to worry about, uh, doing speech - nonspeech then.\nphd a: Yeah that's, that's what the feeling is like. They 're going to give the endpoint information.\nphd f: Mmm.\nprofessor c: G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway,\nphd f: I see.\nprofessor c: everybody does that,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and they wanted to see, given that you 're doing that, what what are the best features that you should use.\nphd f: Yeah, I see.\nphd a: So,\nprofessor c: I mean clearly they 're interact. So I don't know that I entirely agree with it.\nphd f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But but it might be uh In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints, to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But, you know. It's it's still someth reasonable.\nphd f: So, are people supposed to assume that there is uh Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints?\nphd a: Uh \nphd f: Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things?\nphd a: No. No. That i I Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I guess that is that is where the consensus is. Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you.\nphd f: OK.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor c: So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: because you don't have the mistakes in it. Yeah?\nphd a: Yeah. So \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: So that that The baseline itself I mean, it improves by twenty - two percent. I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases, that like, the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint. w\nphd f: Wow.\nphd a: I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty. So, uh,\nphd f: So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent.\nphd a: Yeah, by fifty percent.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: Wow.\nprofessor c: So it's g it's gonna be harder to beat that actually.\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah, so \nprofessor c: But but \nphd a: so that is when uh, the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched. And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now. And uh, Yeah, I guess after that, I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks. Uh.\nprofessor c: OK. No, that's that's that's a good good update.\nphd a: Ye Yeah, and I I came back and I started working on uh, some other speech enhancement algorithm. I mean, so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering. These are the main uh, approaches where people have tried,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot, I I 've been working on this uh, signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace. And \nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab. I have to to to test whether it works first or not\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result. So, yeah.\nprofessor c: S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second. So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is.\nphd a: Yep. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Cool. Um, so maybe uh, just briefly, you could remind us about the related experiments. Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week, I guess?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Um, where you were also combining something both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh, French Telecom system with the u uh \nphd d: Right.\nprofessor c: I I don't know whether it was system one or system two, or?\nphd d: Mm - hmm. It was system one. So\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd d: we The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom, which provide us some speech samples that are uh, with noise removed.\nprofessor c: So I let me let me just stop you there. So then, one distinction is that uh, you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to \nphd a: Uh, no there is a slight different. Uh I mean, which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. But that's what I mean.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But u u Sorry,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah, I 'm not being I 'm not being clear.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something, right?\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: And so one difference is that, I guess you were taking spectra.\nphd a: The speech.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah. But I guess it's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh, handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features,\nphd a: Yeah, the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way \nphd d: right? or?\nphd a: because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech. I mean, if we are using our own code for th I mean that that could be the only difference.\nphd d: Right.\nphd a: I mean, there is no other difference.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But you got some sort of different result. So I 'm trying to understand it. But uh, I th\nphd d: Yeah, well I think we should uh, have a table with all the result because I don't know I uh, I don't exactly know what are your results? But,\nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd d: Mmm. Yeah, but so we did this, and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh, proposal - one system after this without well, with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd d: and\nphd b: And the filter \nphd d: Well there are slight modifications, but it was the full proposal - one. In your case, if you tried just putting LDA, then maybe on - line normalization?\nphd a: Only LDA. Yeah. Af - I after that I added on - line normalization, yeah.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. So we just tried directly to to just, keep the system as it was and, um, when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh, signif significantly. Um, but, what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh, it doesn't help at all. You can remove on - line normalization, or put it, it doesn't change anything. Uh, uh, as long as you have the spectral subtraction. But, you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere, and we don't know where exactly\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: but, uh.\nphd a: Yeah, I assume.\nprofessor c: So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something\nphd d: Right.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: without any change. OK.\nphd b: But it's \nphd d: Yeah. Well,\nphd b: It's the new.\nphd d: with with with changes,\nphd a: with\nphd b: The new.\nphd d: because we change it the system to have \nphd a: Oh yeah, I mean the the new LDA filters.\nphd b: The new.\nphd a: I mean OK.\nphd d: Yeah. LDA filters. There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like, the sixty - four hertz cut - off.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: w Uh, it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits, finally.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: Maybe because of other changes.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: Um, well there are some minor changes, yeah.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And, right now if we look at the results, it's, um, always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch. And it's still slightly worse for well - matched.\nphd b: But\nphd d: Um, but this is not significant. But, the problem is that it's not significant, but if you put this in the, mmm, uh, spreadsheet, it's still worse. Even with very minor uh, even if it's only slightly worse for well - matched.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And significantly better for HM. Uh, but, well. I don't think it's importa important because when they will change their metric, uh, uh, mainly because of uh, when you p you plug the um, frame dropping in the baseline system, it will improve a lot HM, and MM,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: so, um, I guess what will happen I don't know what will happen. But, the different contribution, I think, for the different test set will be more even.\nphd a: Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet so. But the the well - matched may still \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information.\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd a: Yeah. So the the MM \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it. Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, so um, yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. But they d the everything I mean is like, but there that's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But are they changing the weighting?\nphd a: Uh, no, I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So there's nothing on \nprofessor c: I don't understand that.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion, so, um, it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual,\nphd a: Usual.\nprofessor c: in this case. Unusual.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Because, um, you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person's car is like, or\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: uh,\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: It seems like something like the middle one is is more natural.\nphd a: Hmm. Right.\nprofessor c: So I don't know why the well - matched is uh \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah, but actually the well well the well - matched um, uh, I mean the the well - matched condition is not like, uh, the one in TI - digits where uh, you have all the training, uh, conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also. It's like, this is not calibrated by SNR or something. The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the \nprofessor c: The well wa matched has mismatch?\nphd a: has has also some slight mismatches, unlike the TI - digits where it's like prefectly matched\nphd f: Perfect to match.\nphd a: because it's artificially added noise.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: But this is natural recording.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So remind me of what well - matched meant?\nphd a: The the well - matched is like \nprofessor c: You 've told me many times.\nphd a: the the well - matched is defined like it's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing.\nphd d: Yeah. Well, so it means that if the database is large enough, it's matched.\nphd a: It's it's \nphd d: Because it\nphd a: OK, it's \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd d: in each set you have a range of conditions Well \nprofessor c: Right. So, I mean, yeah, unless they deliberately chose it to be different, which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched, it is pretty much You know, so it's so it's sort of saying if you \nphd f: It's it's not guaranteed though.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, it's not guaranteed.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd a: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually.\nprofessor c: Again, if you have enough if you have enough \nphd a: No yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: So it's sort of i i it's sort of saying OK, so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer, um, you you have a car, and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions, or something, and then I don't think that's very realistic, I mean I th\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I I you know, so I I I you know, I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially, that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars, and and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that's the argument, but I 'm not sure I buy it, so.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, So What else is going on?\nphd d: Mmm. You Yeah. We are playing we are also playing, trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm, in the code. Um, it would be a very simple spectral subtraction, on the um, mel energies which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually, and I think it's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction.\nphd f: Is it is spectral subtraction typically done on the after the mel, uh, scaling or is it done on the FFT bins?\nphd d: Um,\nphd f: Does it matter, or?\nphd d: I d I don't know. Well, it's both both uh, cases can i\nphd f: Oh.\nphd d: Yeah. So - some of the proposal, uh, we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins,\nphd f: Hmm.\nphd d: others on the um, mel energies. You can do both, but I cannot tell you what's which one might be better or I \nphd f: Hmm.\nphd a: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech, it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins.\nphd d: I don't know. Yeah, but\nphd f: Mmm.\nphd a: But for speech recognition, it may not. I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT. So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that.\nphd f: I see.\nphd a: Well Yeah?\nphd f: Hmm.\nphd a: So, it may not be really a big different.\nphd d: Well, it gives something different, but I don't know what are the, pros and cons of both.\nphd a: It I Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd a: So\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique, uh, is it like one stage speech enhancement? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals, which is really giving them some improvement.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean they just do the same thing again once more.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And So, there's something that is good about doing it I mean, to cleaning it up once more.\nphd d: Yeah, it might be.\nphd a: Yeah,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: so we can \nphd d: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing\nphd a: Yeah. That's what\nprofessor c: Well, the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing.\nphd d: and Yeah.\nprofessor c: I mean maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first.\nphd a: That's wh Yeah. So,\nprofessor c: Right, so he's doing a signal subspace thing, maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction, or maybe vi maybe the other way around,\nphd d: Yeah, mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: you know?\nphd a: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: How is it I I guess I 'm ignorant about this, how does I mean, since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals, how is how is that differ from signal subspace?\nphd a: The signal subspace? The \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it.\nprofessor c: Oh, OK.\nphd a: Yeah. It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter. Is the signal is is a signal substrate.\nprofessor c: Oh, oh, OK so the difference is the KL.\nphd a: So, the the different the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad. It's it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions, and in colored noise.\nprofessor c: I see. So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform, followed by a\nphd a: Wiener filtering. It's a it's a cascade of two s\nprofessor c: Wiener filter. Yeah, in general, you don't that's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy. Actually. Um, that was something that uh, Herve and I were talking about with um, the multi - band stuff, that if you 're converting things to from uh, bands, groups of bands into cepstral coef you know, local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. OK. Yeah. So.\nprofessor c: Uh, so.\nphd a: So that that's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve SNR a little bit, first stage,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further.\nphd d: What was your point about about colored noise there?\nphd a: Oh, the colored noise uh \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean, it it actually depends on inverting the matrices. So it it ac the covariance matrix of the noise. So if if it is not positive definite,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean it has a it's It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite.\nprofessor c: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise.\nphd a: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering, first of the colo colored noise\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then make the noise white,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back, you do this filtering again.\nphd d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor c: I was only half kidding. I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction, that also gets rid \nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition I mean, that sort of what J JRASTA does, in a way.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise,\nphd a: Huh? Uh - huh.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: in order to get rid of the effects of noise.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd d: Yeah. Uh, yeah. So there is this. And maybe we well we find some people so that uh, agree to maybe work with us, and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it's um, Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm, uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra. So. Well, if you take the standard model of channel plus noise, uh, it's it's a nonlinear eh uh, transformation in the cepstral domain.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. Yes.\nphd d: And uh, there is a way to approximate this using uh, first - order or second - order Taylor Series and it can be used for uh, getting rid of the noise and the channel effect.\nprofessor c: Who is doing this?\nphd d: Uh w working in the cepstral domain? So there is one guy in Grenada,\nphd b: Yeah, in Grenada one of my friend.\nphd d: and another in uh, Lucent that I met at ICASSP.\nprofessor c: Who's the guy in Grenada?\nphd d: uh,\nphd b: Uh, Jose Carlos Segura.\nprofessor c: I don't know him.\nphd a: This VTS has been proposed by CMU?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Is it is it the CMU? Yeah, yeah, OK.\nphd b: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Originally the idea was from CMU.\nphd a: From C.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh - huh.\nphd d: Well, it's again a different thing that could be tried. Um,\nprofessor c: Uh - huh.\nphd d: Mmm, yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, so at any rate, you 're looking general, uh, standing back from it, looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh, noise removal, uh, with with these other things we have,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: uh, looks like a worthy thing to to do here.\nphd d: Uh, yeah. But, yeah. But for sure there's required to that requires to re - check everything else, and re - optimize the other things\nprofessor c: Oh yeah.\nphd d: and, for sure the on - line normalization may be the LDA filter. Um,\nprofessor c: Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari's here,\nphd d: I \nprofessor c: cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too or I guess not next week,\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: week and a half, uh, will be sort of go through these alternatives, what we 've seen so far, and come up with some game plans. Um. You know. So, I mean one way would he Here are some alternate visions. I mean one would be, you look at a few things very quickly, you pick on something that looks like it's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing. Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things, and and you know, have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what's better,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and then, you know, uh, but, w um, uh, he 'll have some ideas on that too.\nphd a: The other thing is to, uh Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks. But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage, which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all. So, there are some I mean, I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks. And it's Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere. But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction, we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @.\nprofessor c: So they 're making there Somebody's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something?\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits, and?\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, OK.\nphd a: I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that. Guenter Hirsch and TI.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: Maybe Roger r Roger, maybe in charge of.\nprofessor c: And then they 're they 're uh, uh, generating HTK scripts to \nphd a: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. There are they have there is no I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State,\nprofessor c: Mis - Mississippi State maybe,\nphd a: yeah. I 'm not sure about that.\nprofessor c: yeah. Yeah, so that 'll be a little little task in itself.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Um, well we 've Yeah, it's true for the additive noise, y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too. But for n there's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News. So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and some of the focus conditions were noisy and and \nphd a: It had additive n\nprofessor c: But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction. We were doing our funny stuff, right? We were doing multi multi uh, multi - stream and and so forth.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But it, you know, we di stuff we did helped. I mean it, did something.\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: So. Um, now we have this um, meeting data. You know, like the stuff we 're recording right now,\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and uh, that we have uh, for the uh, the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually. It's the far field mike. And uh, we have uh, the digits that we do at the end of these things. And that's what most o again, most of our work has been done with that, with with uh, connected digits.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Um, but uh, we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech, large vocabulary continuous speech, using Switchboard uh, Switchboard recognizer,\nphd a: Yeah. OK.\nprofessor c: uh, no training, from this, just just plain using the Switchboard.\nphd a: Oh. You just take the Switchboard trained? Yeah,\nprofessor c: That's that's what we 're doing,\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah. Now there are some adaptation though,\nphd a: OK. Yeah. That's cool.\nprofessor c: that that uh, Andreas has been playing with,\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: but we 're hop uh, actually uh, Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future, trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on, uh, some of the large vocabulary data. Um, I mean, I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh, the SRI recognizer and, uh,\nphd f: I don't not that I know of.\nprofessor c: Yeah, cuz everybody's scared.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it,\nphd f: That's right\nprofessor c: but uh, yeah. But, you 're right that that that's a real good point, that uh, we we don't know yeah, uh, I mean, what if any of these ta I guess that's why they 're pushing that in the uh in the evaluation.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, But um, Good. OK. Anything else going on? at you guys ' end,\nphd b: I don't have good result, with the inc including the new parameters,\nprofessor c: or?\nphd b: I don't have good result. Are similar or a little bit worse.\nphd a: With what what other new p new parameter?\ngrad g: You 're talking about your voicing?\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So maybe You probably need to back up a bit\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: seeing as how Sunil,\nphd b: I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter,\nprofessor c: yeah.\nphd b: the coe the cepstrum coefficient,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: that, like, the auto - correlation, the R - zero and R - one over R - zero\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si uh, spectrum of the signal and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank.\nphd a: I 'm so sorry. I didn't get it.\nphd b: Nuh. Well. Anyway. The First you have the sp the spectrum of the signal,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal.\nphd a: Mmm. OK.\nphd b: I do the difference \nphd a: OK.\nphd b: I found a difference at the variance of this different\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: because, suppose we we think that if the variance is high, maybe you have n uh, noise.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: And if the variance is small, maybe you have uh, speech.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: To to To The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: And we try to use this new feature feature. And I did experiment I need to change to obtain this new feature I need to change the size the window size size. of the a of the analysis window size, to have more information.\nphd a: Yeah. Make it longer.\nphd b: Uh, sixty - two point five milliseconds I think.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: And I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence\nphd a: Unvoiced. Well.\nphd b: and to to concat this new feature. But the result are n with the neural network I have more or less the same result.\nphd a: As using just the cepstrum,\nphd b: Result.\nphd a: or?\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: Yeah. It's neve e e sometime it's worse, sometime it's a little bit better, but not significantly.\nphd a: Uh, is it with TI - digits, or with?\nphd b: And No, I work with eh, Italian and Spanish basically.\nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd b: And if I don't y use the neural network, and use directly the feature the results are worse.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: But Doesn't help.\nprofessor c: I I I really wonder though.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I mean we 've had these discussions before, and and one of the things that struck me was that uh, about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things, uh, in an irreversible way, um, you throw away some information. And, that's mostly viewed on as a good thing, in the way we use it, because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular, uh, phonetic units. Um, but, you 'll do throw something away. And so the question is, uh, can we figure out if there's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have. And um. So, when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank, I was thinking \" oh, OK, so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise, or voice voiced property whatever. \" So that that's interesting. Maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features. But for me sort of the interesting thing was, \" well, but is there just something in that difference which is useful? \" So another way of doing it, maybe, would be just to take the FFT uh, power spectrum, and feed it into a neural network,\nphd b: To know \nprofessor c: and then use it, you know, in combination, or alone, or or whatever\nphd f: Wi - with what targets?\nphd a: Voiced, unvoiced is like \nprofessor c: Uh, no.\nphd a: Oh. Or anything.\nprofessor c: No the just the same same way we 're using I mean, the same way that we 're using the filter bank.\nphd f: Phones.\nphd a: Oh, OK.\nprofessor c: Exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I mean, the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it's good. But it's different. And, you know, maybe if it's used in combination, it will get at something that we 're missing. And maybe, you know, using, orth you know, KLT, or uh, um, adding probabilities, I mean, all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with, that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that's useful, that we 're missing here.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, but there is so much variability in the power spectrum.\nprofessor c: Well, that's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself, but it might help in combination.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor c: But I I I have to tell you, I can't remember the conference, but, uh, I think it's about ten years ago, I remember going to one of the speech conferences and and uh, I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something, and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh, just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better. So I mean the i i It's true there's lots of variability,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability, and you know, doing something reasonable with it.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So, um, uh, It - it's same, you know, argument that's gone both ways about uh, you know, we have these data driven filters, in LDA, and on the other hand, if it's data driven it means it's driven by things that have lots of variability, and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test, so, in some ways it's good to have data driven things, and in some ways it's bad to have data driven things. So,\nphd a: Yeah, d\nprofessor c: part of what we 're discovering, is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, so anyway, it's just a thought, that that if we if we had that maybe it's just a baseline uh, which would show us \" well, what are we really getting out of the filters \", or maybe i i probably not by itself, but in combination, uh,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: you know, maybe there's something to be gained from it, and let the But, you know, y you 've only worked with us for a short time, maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information. But, maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you.\nphd b: Maybe.\nprofessor c: So.\nphd b: Yeah,\nprofessor c: It's just a thought.\nphd b: I can I will try to do that.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora, the th what we did was like, I I guess most of you know about this, adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: That is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the TI - digits. So, a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping. That's it.\nphd d: Wait I I 'm sorry?\nphd a: Yeah, we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum, just the baseline.\nphd d: Yeah?\nphd b: You did some experiment.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah. Well, in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything, because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: and it was very short. But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian.\nphd d: Hmm. Well Mm - hmm. But anyway the question is even more, is within speech, can we get some features? Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech,\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: I mean. To maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds?\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: And it's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh. So.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: Um.\nphd a: There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the uh extracting some higher - order uh, information from the cepstral coefficients and I forgot the name. Some is some harmonics I don't know, I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP. It \nprofessor c: Talking cumulants or something?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Huh? Uh, I don't know.\nprofessor c: Cumulants or something.\nphd a: I don't remember.\nprofessor c: But No.\nphd a: It wa it was taking the, um It was about finding the higher - order moments of Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah,\nphd a: And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments, or \nprofessor c: cumulants, yeah.\nphd a: maybe higher - order cumulants\nprofessor c: Oh.\nphd a: and Yeah. It was it was \nprofessor c: Or m e\nphd a: Yeah. I mean, he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: some improvement on the noisy speech.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Some small vocabulary tasks.\nprofessor c: Uh.\nphd a: So it was on PLP derived cepstral coefficients.\nprofessor c: Yeah, but again You could argue that th that's exactly what the neural network does.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: So n neural network uh, is in some sense equivalent to computing, you know, higher - order moments of what you \nphd a: trying to f to Moments, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah. So. I mean, it doesn't do it very specifically,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and pretty you know. But.\nphd a: Yep.\nprofessor c: Uh, anything on your end you want to talk about? Uh.\ngrad g: Um, nothing I wanna really talk about. I can I can just uh, um, share a little bit Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about uh, what I 've been doing.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad g: Um, so, um, I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam. So basically that's just, um, trying to propose um, uh, your next your your following years of of your PHD work, trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on. So, I 've been, uh, looking into, um, doing something about r uh, speech recognition using acoustic events. So, um, the idea is you have all these these different events, for example voicing, nasality, R - coloring, you know burst or noise, uh, frication, that kinda stuff, um, building robust um, primary detectors for these acoustic events, and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition. Um, and, um, these these primary detectors, um, will be, uh, inspired by, you know, multi - band techniques, um, doing things, um, similar to Larry Saul's work on, uh, graphical models to to detect these these, uh, acoustic events. And, um, so I I been I been thinking about that and some of the issues that I 've been running into are, um, exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need, what um, what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps. And, also, um, once I decide a set of acoustic events, um, h how do I how do I get labels? Training data for for these acoustic events. And, then later on down the line, I can start playing with the the models themselves, the the primary detectors. Um, so, um, I kinda see like, after after building the primary detectors I see um, myself taking the outputs and feeding them in, sorta tandem style into into a um, Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end, um, and doing recognition. Um. So, that's that's just generally what I 've been looking at.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad g: Um,\nprofessor c: By by the way, uh, the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at.\ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: you know, um, if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is, it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: that one might be another thing.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Yeah. Yeah. Um, were were you gonna say something?\nphd f: Mmm.\ngrad g: Oh. It looked OK, never mind. Um, yeah. And so, this this past week um, I 've been uh, looking a little bit into uh, TRAPS um, and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too, just, um, seeing seeing if that's possible. Uh, and um, other than that, uh, I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years.\nprofessor c: Oh no. So you live in a cardboard box in the street now\ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor c: or, no?\ngrad g: Uh, well, s s som something like that.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad g: In Albany, yeah. Yeah. And uh. Yep. That's it.\nprofessor c: Suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place?\nphd a: Uh, no\nprofessor c: Is that out of the way?\nphd a: not yet. Uh, yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth and she said she's interviewing two more people. So. And she would get back to me on Monday. So that's that's only thing I have and Diane has a few more houses. She's going to take some pictures and send me after I go back. So it's that's \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd f: Oh. So you 're not down here permanently yet?\nphd a: No. I 'm going back to OGI today.\nphd f: Ah! Oh, OK.\ngrad g: Oh.\nprofessor c: OK. And then, you 're coming back uh \nphd a: Uh, i I mean, I I p I plan to be here on thirty - first.\nprofessor c: Thirty - first,\nphd a: Yeah, well if there's a house available or place to \nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad g: Thirty - first.\nprofessor c: Well, I mean i i if if \nphd a: Yeah, I hope.\nprofessor c: They 're available, and they 'll be able to get you something, so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while\nphd a: Yeah. So, in that case, I 'm going to be here on thirty - first definitely.\nprofessor c: until you OK.\ngrad e: You know, if you 're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay, you could stay with me for a while. I 've got a spare bedroom right now.\nphd a: Oh. OK. Thanks. That sure is nice of you. So, it may be he needs more than me.\ngrad g: Oh r oh. Oh no, no. My my cardboard box is actually a nice spacious two bedroom apartment.\nprofessor c: So a two bedroom cardboard box. Th - that's great.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Thanks Dave.\ngrad g: yeah\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Um,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Do y wanna say anything about You you actually been Uh, last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre, you were you were mentioning. Is that that something worth talking about, or?\ngrad e: Um, it's Well, um, it I don't think it directly relates. Um, well, so, I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi and he's int He wanted to um, look at um, how people respond to formant changes, I think. Um. So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions, and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um, spectrum. And he wanted to look at um, how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum and compare that to the to the listener tests. And, um. So, I gave him a PLP spectrum. And to um he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving. So I took the um, PLP LPC coefficients and um, I found the roots. This was something that Stephane suggested. I found the roots of the um, LPC polynomial to, um, track the peaks in the, um, PLP LPC spectra.\nphd a: well there is aligned spectral pairs, is like the the Is that the aligned s\nprofessor c: It's a r root LPC, uh, of some sort.\nphd a: Oh, no.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So you just \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: instead of the log you took the root square, I mean cubic root or something. What di w I didn't get that.\nprofessor c: No, no. It's it's it's taking the finding the roots of the LPC polynomial.\nphd a: Polynomial. Yeah. Is that the line spectral \nprofessor c: So it's like line spectral pairs.\nphd a: Oh, it's like line sp\nprofessor c: Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle, don't they,\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: to sort of? But it But uh, you know. But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago, the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and uh, finding the roots. It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet, but it was just LPC, and uh, we found the roots of the polynomial, And th When you do that, sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants, sometimes they 're not.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: So it's it's it's a little,\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor c: uh Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech,\nphd f: So you just You typically just get a few roots?\nprofessor c: but.\nphd f: You know, two or three,\nprofessor c: Well you get these complex pairs.\nphd f: something like that?\nprofessor c: And it depends on the order that you 're doing, but.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Right. So, um, if @ @ Every root that's Since it's a real signal, the LPC polynomial's gonna have real coefficients. So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is gonna be a c complex pair,\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: um, of a complex value and its conjugate. Um. So for each And if you look at that on the unit circle, um, one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency, one will be a negative frequency, I think. So I just So, um, f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and I 'll get three or four of these pairs\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Hmm.\ngrad e: which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions.\nprofessor c: This is from synthetic speech, or?\ngrad e: It's Right. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So if it's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner. I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is, like I say, funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well.\nphd f: How did \nprofessor c: But but mostly they are.\nphd d: But\nprofessor c: Mostly they do.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad e: Mmm,\nprofessor c: And and what I mean in in what we were doing, which was not so much looking at things, it was OK\nphd d: I \nprofessor c: because it was just a question of quantization. Uh, we were just you know, storing It was We were doing, uh, stored speech, uh, quantization.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But but uh, in your case um, you know \nphd d: Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant's positions, but they are lower in energy\ngrad e: But there's some of that, yes.\nphd d: and Well they are much lower.\nphd f: If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly? I mean h how is the speech created?\ngrad e: It was created from a synthesizer, and um \nphd f: Wasn't a formant synthesizer was it?\nprofessor c: I bet it it might have may have been\ngrad e: I d d this \nprofessor c: but maybe he didn't have control over it or something?\ngrad e: In in fact w we we could get, um, formant frequencies out of the synthesizer, as well. And, um, w one thing that the, um, LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition, um, is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well. Um, Stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order IIR filter.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Um, but I don't think there's a g a really good reason not to um, get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead. Except that you don't have the psycho - acoustic modeling in that.\nprofessor c: Yeah, so the actual So you 're not getting the actual formants per se. You 're getting the Again, you 're getting sort of the, uh \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: You 're getting something that is is uh, af strongly affected by the PLP model. And so it's more psycho - acoustic. So it's a little It's It's It's sort of sort of a different thing.\nphd f: Oh, I see. That's sort of the point.\nprofessor c: But Yeah. i Ordinarily, in a formant synthesizer, the bandwidths as well as the ban uh, formant centers are \nphd f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: I mean, that's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in, as as what you \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But but yeah, you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section, which has, uh, band center and band width, and um, um But. Yeah. O K. So, uh, yeah, you 're going back today and then back in a week I guess,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and. Yeah. Great! Well, welcome.\nphd a: Thanks.\nphd f: I guess we should do digits quickly.\nprofessor c: Oh yeah, digits.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor c: I almost forgot that.\nphd b: Digits.\nprofessor c: I almost forgot our daily digits.\nphd f: You wanna go ahead?\nprofessor c: Sure.\nphd f: OK."

        "input": "phd f: We um So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines, uh, to use as sort of a compute farm. And um, uh, we ordered uh, SUN - Blade - one - hundreds, and um, I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in, but, uh, in addition, we 're running So the plan for using these is, uh, we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh, fixed up and up to speed. And he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um, run things using P - make and Customs. You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that. The simplest thing And I can send an email around or, maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something. Um,\nprofessor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ,\nphd f: there's a c\nprofessor c: you know what I 'm saying?\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: so that you can Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, there's a command, uh, that you can use called \" run command \". \" Run dash command \", \" run hyphen command \". And, if you say that and then some job that you want to execute, uh, it will find the fastest currently available machine, and export your job to that machine, and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment. So you can try this as a simple test with uh, the L S command. So you can say \" run dash command L S \", and, um, it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute, and um, do an LS on your current directory. So, substitute LS for whatever command you want to run, and um And that's a simple way to get started using using this. And, so, soon, when we get all the new machines up, um, e then we 'll have lots more compute to use. Now th one of the nice things is that uh, each machine that's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it. Uh, attributes like how much memory the machine has, what its speed is, what its operating system, and when you use something like \" run command \", you can specify those attributes for your program. For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux, you can give it the Linux attribute, and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that. So. You can control where your jobs go, to a certain extent, all the way down to an individual machine. Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself. So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that. If there's already a job running, on some machine that you 're trying to select, your job will get queued up, and then when that resource, that machine becomes available, your job will get exported there. So, there's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh, right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're Uh. The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it.\nprofessor c: So as I understand, you know, he's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines,\nphd f: So.\nprofessor c: is the rough division of \nphd f: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, you know, I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and uh, uh I fired off a training job, and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying, \" uh, are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run. \" So I had to back off a little bit. But, soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available. So, um, that's just a quick update about what we 've got. So.\ngrad g: Um, I have I have a question about the uh, parallelization?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So, um, let's say I have like, a thousand little little jobs to do?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um, how do I do it with \" run command \"? I mean do \nphd f: You could write a script uh, which called run command on each sub - job\ngrad g: Uh - huh. A thousand times?\nphd f: right? But you probably wanna be careful with that\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: because um, you don't wanna saturate the network. Uh, so, um, you know, you should you should probably not run more than, say ten jobs yourself at any one time, uh, just because then it would keep other people \ngrad g: Oh, too much file transfer and stuff.\nphd f: Well it's not that so much as that, you know, e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and, you know, people's jobs would get delayed, so it's sort of a sharing thing. Um,\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time. Um. So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run, um, you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \", uh, to only have ten of those going at a time. And uh, then, when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one. Um,\nprofessor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop, I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine.\nphd f: Yeah. Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful.\nprofessor c: as I recall, but. Yeah.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd f: Um, but uh, you can also If you have that level of parallelization um, and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that, you can use um, P - make\ngrad g: Just do P - make.\nphd f: and and you basically write a Make file that uh, you know your final job depends on these one thousand things,\ngrad g: s Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and when you run P - make, uh, on your Make file, you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and that number represents how many uh, machines to use at once. And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd f: So,\ngrad g: Right. OK.\nphd f: I can get some documentation.\nphd d: So it it's it's not systematically queued. I mean all the jobs are running. If you launch twenty jobs, they are all running. Alright."

Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Do does every ones have the slide?\nproject manager: The \nmarketing: Three point one.\nproject manager: that was material.\nmarketing: Slide show. Material technologically innovative, okay. Um,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know, anyone? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Which one is that again sorry? Three point one?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one.\nproject manager: Does the shape \nmarketing: The shape.\nuser interface: I think \nmarketing: Four point two?\nproject manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger?\nindustrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be mm.\nproject manager: Because \nuser interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better.\nindustrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish.\nproject manager: Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: The flat one. Yeah.\nproject manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position.\nuser interface: I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat \nindustrial designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm.\nuser interface: But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think the broccoli would be out.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. That looked really good.\nuser interface: I don't know. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no?\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Rhubarb.\nmarketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: These obscure fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh despite the \nuser interface: I think we needn't \nproject manager: What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry.\nuser interface: Yeah. That could work.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nproject manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: But if we if we need \nmarketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something.\nproject manager: yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So like maybe that's just too big\nproject manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that,\nuser interface: because \nproject manager: which is a nice kind of \nuser interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. But \nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?\nuser interface: I guess \nproject manager: 'Cause like kind of \nindustrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or like even \nuser interface: Dif\nindustrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough.\nproject manager: Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped.\nproject manager: 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Alright.\nproject manager: But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that?\nmarketing: Um \nuser interface: We could tr I don't know.\nmarketing: Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more.\nproject manager: The batteries are going in the back?\nindustrial designer: That everyone gave that a one or a two. Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip \nindustrial designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door,\nproject manager: no you could Just like any other one. Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah um like on a normal remote.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there, but it'd be on one of the sides probably.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: I think everyone's under three anyway.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: So I think it's yeah those are the only two points.\nuser interface: Cool. Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We were a bit off task.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like,\nindustrial designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.\nuser interface: but you could do like Yeah that's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce, 'cause they're irregular.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm.\nindustrial designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.\nproject manager: Yeah. Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm."

It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute.\nproject manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally.\nindustrial designer: Well you told us when to start and when to end, and that's all that matters.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Excuse me, am I allowed to say that?

Very democratic. No spats, that was good.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Like the the pens, the whiteboard,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean we used \nindustrial designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.\nproject manager: Are you a Mac person? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no I never touch Macs either.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I just use the Unix or the off market, sort of WordPerfect and all these other things.\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Which isn't very user-friendly though. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it. So I have all these documents I can't use now. But yeah I mean I guess it's okay.\nuser interface: I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role, but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally, think it's kinda stupid.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I never use it.\nuser interface: Yeah but uh \nproject manager: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful. Like I \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: It didn't really yeah.\nproject manager: It \nindustrial designer: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works.\nmarketing: I though it was brilliant no? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Really? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think.\nproject manager: I mean m my problem \nindustrial designer: Yeah it probably does.\nuser interface: So like a f\nmarketing: I think it depends on the role\nproject manager: yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I think so.\nmarketing: no?\nproject manager: 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: See I couldn't do that, so I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it I was just like \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'cause I \nindustrial designer: Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: As if you'd wanted to.\nmarketing: Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um\nproject manager: System. Yeah.\nmarketing: a whole system,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I mean, it \nindustrial designer: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together, like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap, and you have how people want it to be spongy, and \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, huh.\nindustrial designer: It seems planned you know.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information, or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time. But um \nproject manager: Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's \nindustrial designer: If I hadn't been told that fruit was \nmarketing: But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing.\nproject manager: Oh right. given certain information or Just \nmarketing: Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input \nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: I don't have a clue, anyway.\nproject manager: Mm, mm.\nmarketing: Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um \nproject manager: What do you guys think of the pens?\nmarketing: It's quite \nproject manager: It asks about that.\nindustrial designer: They're pretty cool.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: I wanna s\nindustrial designer: They're kinda hard to write with though.\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the \nindustrial designer: They're nicer than the pen that I'm using, because like your stuff actually shows up here, rather than having to look at the screen and write.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But even so, I dunno.\nproject manager: And new ideas found?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah it's all very new,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: no? It's all very new.\nuser interface: Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno. Like it was the \nmarketing: Sorry.\nuser interface: I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah. Well they drop off if you like move too much.\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. But they're they're okay.\nindustrial designer: But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: I don't know. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh I think, and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well the thing is, like I actually worked in a company,\nuser interface: or like I dunno.\nindustrial designer: and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting. Like usually I missed meetings deliberately.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting, like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's mostly like rehashing old stuff.\nuser interface: Hm.\nindustrial designer: And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through.\nproject manager: Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration.\nindustrial designer: It seems like way overkill.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful, 'cause can't really imagine, dunno. How about a p a?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um I dunno.\nproject manager: Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Any other ideas for \nmarketing: What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending?\nproject manager: Um we still have time if there's any other input.\nmarketing: Is that the end?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean the I think we did really well personally, which is why we've you know, gone through this so quickly. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So. Um.\nmarketing: End of meeting. You have to tell her, she \nproject manager: So I think that's all for today. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay we have to fill in all this stuff.\nuser interface: M meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Stuff stuff stuff.\nproject manager: Meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think it would be a good idea, I like it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention. Especially if you have food.\nproject manager: So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. 'Cause \nindustrial designer: All of us?\nproject manager: I don't know.

Four point one.\nproject manager: Does the shape \nmarketing: The shape.\nuser interface: I think \nmarketing: Four point two?\nproject manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger?\nindustrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be mm.\nproject manager: Because \nuser interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better.\nindustrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish.\nproject manager: Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: The flat one. Yeah.\nproject manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position.\nuser interface: I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat \nindustrial designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm.\nuser interface: But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think the broccoli would be out.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. That looked really good.\nuser interface: I don't know. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no?\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Rhubarb.\nmarketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: These obscure fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh despite the \nuser interface: I think we needn't \nproject manager: What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry.\nuser interface: Yeah. That could work.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nproject manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: But if we if we need \nmarketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something.\nproject manager: yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So like maybe that's just too big\nproject manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that,\nuser interface: because \nproject manager: which is a nice kind of \nuser interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. But \nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?\nuser interface: I guess \nproject manager: 'Cause like kind of \nindustrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or like even \nuser interface: Dif\nindustrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough.\nproject manager: Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped.\nproject manager: 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Alright.\nproject manager: But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that?\nmarketing: Um \nuser interface: We could tr I don't know.\nmarketing: Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more.\nproject manager: The batteries are going in the back?\nindustrial designer: That everyone gave that a one or a two. Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip \nindustrial designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door,\nproject manager: no you could Just like any other one. Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah um like on a normal remote.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there, but it'd be on one of the sides probably.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: I think everyone's under three anyway.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: So I think it's yeah those are the only two points.\nuser interface: Cool. Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We were a bit off task.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like,\nindustrial designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.\nuser interface: but you could do like Yeah that's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce, 'cause they're irregular.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm.\nindustrial designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.\nproject manager: Yeah. Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm."

Okay. Okay. So, this is our product or prototype. This is made by clay.\nproject manager: Looks strange. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. Yellow is uh our company colour,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive. So we used two basic colour, yellow and red. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: It's we call it a mushroom design.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh \nuser interface: So this is a introduction of our product.\nproject manager: Genetically modified mushroom I will say, but\nuser interface: Next a mo\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay,\nproject manager: keep on speaking.\nuser interface: yeah, so next slide. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market.\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah I'm sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe, I hope so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, so it's a fuzzy design, and a unique design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's true.\nuser interface: Um, and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle, so we can turn this ball to t to select channel.\nproject manager: Chan\nuser interface: So it's quite convenient for user to use it.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, but don't touch don't destroy your prototype. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, s {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: okay. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable, so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it. So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button. You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom, so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Everything's mushroom. So we can call our remote control the mushroom.\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah, everything's mushroom. Mush Mushroom design, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, centre is yellow and t d\nuser interface: Yeah\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, th that's why if you put it in the table, be careful, somebody will eat it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: To integrate, you know yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it You know, to integrate the fruit aspect, you know the the in\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Fruits and vegetables.\nindustrial designer: Really? But Fruit and vegetable,\nproject manager: Vegetables. Mushroom is a vegetable.\nindustrial designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think it is.\nproject manager: It's vegetable.\nindustrial designer: Mushroom?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh, uh I'm not sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So th it's something eatable.\nindustrial designer: We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway, so it's fine.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know. This, you know, very enlighted colours, you know.\nmarketing: No, I mean, yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is \nindustrial designer: And inspired colour\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and and very sophisticated material, so.\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: And so {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Next slide.\nuser interface: Uh, no this our only two slides. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: So what we w what I can add is that, you know he talk about what is outside, so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about, you know, the chip,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: it is a low level chip, and \nuser interface: So we cut it to see. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know, we don't need to k.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i\nuser interface: Okay. So where's the battery battery?\nindustrial designer: The battery it is under .\nproject manager: In the base.\nindustrial designer: It is in th in in the base, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: In the basement. In the basement.\nuser interface: Base. Here?\nproject manager: And where is the solar solar cell?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar.\nproject manager: Where is the solar cell?\nindustrial designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and \nproject manager: Oh. Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price?\nuser interface: Okay\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think so,\nproject manager: Okay, we'll see after.\nindustrial designer: but it it's might be okay, so.\nproject manager: We will have first to \nindustrial designer: I it might be okay. So \nproject manager: so, mister money, what's your opinion according to this remote control?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean, we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and first one was uh\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale, one being uh no, I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh just let me check.\nindustrial designer: So, four point three point five, it means it's acceptable.\nmarketing: One one being true, and seven being false. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: Ouch. So\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think you have nice colours. I don't {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But is it \nindustrial designer: The sha the bowl shape people like.\nuser interface: Yeah, the shape is unique, and the colour \nmarketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really \nindustrial designer: Is it really fancy?\nuser interface: So it depend on how d do you define fancy.\nmarketing: Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, and maybe do things like that \nindustrial designer: Do Don't do that, please.\nmarketing: I dunno where the lemon is, but\nindustrial designer: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like, so \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean it's not obvious.\nproject manager: It would be bet more like a lemon?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If \nindustrial designer: Because i\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Less button.\nuser interface: Uh so, my mush .\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but you don't have any button now.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: And you know, you have the finger here, with the buttons?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's uh yeah, is that \nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: that's a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's getting \nproject manager: It looks more like a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: So that's great. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sorry.\nindustrial designer: That's great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What's the use for that?\nindustrial designer: I have no idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh, for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I have no idea what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And where is the voice recognition?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh. Ah, it's embedded, your microphone.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Th this th th there's two two functions.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point.\nuser interface: This is microphone array \nmarketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: If it is fancy or not.\nproject manager: Okay. Is it better like that?\nmarketing: I mean {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Looks okay,\nindustrial designer: So we can we can say t\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: let's say it's a pineapple now. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The colour, is the colour acceptable?\nmarketing: No, the colour is okay, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: So the shape now.\nmarketing: I mean it's \nproject manager: It looks like a \nmarketing: but I would say there is more too much red.\nproject manager: now you took it.\nindustrial designer: It's too much red?\nmarketing: Um if\nindustrial designer: In the basement?\nproject manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Right. So, from one to seven?\nindustrial designer: I will give I will \nproject manager: Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum?\nindustrial designer: I'll gi\nmarketing: No, seven is false and one is true.\nindustrial designer: I'll give two or three.\nproject manager: Three, I will say three.\nindustrial designer: Three, it's okay. Three, three. Three is fine for me.\nmarketing: Three?\nuser interface: 'Kay\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Isn't it bitter like that?\nmarketing: Three.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then uh let me \nindustrial designer: What other \nmarketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative.\nindustrial designer: Is it easy to use? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an\nindustrial designer: Ye uh Embedded.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact.\nindustrial designer: It's a micro array, okay.\nuser interface: There four microphone.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay,\nuser interface: So they they they they there's a microphone array.\nproject manager: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments?\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative?\nuser interface: So you can capture voice yeah, you c\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I\nmarketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single.\nindustrial designer: W Yeah, but \nproject manager: We have tactile buttons.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I see, you have microphone array embedded. You have \nmarketing: No, that's good. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's good.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay.\nindustrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable, so \nproject manager: Maybe two?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So using the same scale, two?\nproject manager: Two? I would say two\nindustrial designer: Two, yeah, two. It's it's fine, so.\nproject manager:. You agree?\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's better like that, isn't it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now maybe the most critical one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Most \nmarketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very easy.\nindustrial designer: You just need the command.\nuser interface: You can use this in this way.\nmarketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As a principle. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Please.\nuser interface: Th this is the base.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can turn to change the channel.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\nuser interface: You just tu turn d d\nindustrial designer: I think maybe if you he\nproject manager: Oh, ok I understand.\nmarketing: Like if you want to go from \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You take take the remote, so \nindustrial designer: If you hear some click \nproject manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but imagine you y\nproject manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no, no. I if y uh if \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the \nmarketing: Yeah. I agree. I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I \nmarketing: But I mean if you're fro from two?\nuser interface: I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine,\nmarketing: So, average?\nindustrial designer: nine over three.\nuser interface: Three?\nmarketing: Three?\nproject manager: Trois. Three. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, it's .\nuser interface: Trois. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, so \nindustrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work, but it's \nmarketing: Yeah, especially on the easy to use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh s yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: target.\nindustrial designer: Might it might be fine.\nproject manager: So, th the project is accepted?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, b I think \nproject manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So uh mm mm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: That's the finance.\nproject manager: Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept, under certain conditions, the prototype, we'll have look to the final sh financial view.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm. Okay.\nproject manager: So we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet, so\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so it has the energy source. We have hand dynamo. No, we don't use that.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: We have battery, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have battery.\nproject manager: Kinetic, we don't have it, I suppose,\nindustrial designer: No,\nproject manager: but we have solar cells.\nindustrial designer: um solar cells, yeah.\nproject manager: Um, how many do y do you need, solar cells? Do you think one would be enough, or such as as number of branches?\nindustrial designer: Uh I think in each ball you have three \nproject manager: Three?\nindustrial designer: three uh yeah, three, yeah. Three three solar cells.\nproject manager: So, electronic. Single simple chip on print? Just one would be necessary?\nindustrial designer: S s simple, simple, yeah.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Zero for the others. And sample sensor, sample speaker. One?\nindustrial designer: Mm. One maybe, yeah.\nproject manager: As we have voice recognition, I think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: So the case.\nindustrial designer: Is it \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is sh it \nmarketing: So we are all already nineteen.\nindustrial designer: Wooden. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: just keep on going, just to have an idea.\nuser interface: The solar cell is too expensive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's \nproject manager: Well uh \nindustrial designer: There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think.\nproject manager: yeah, but what what about case? Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved. I think it's more like double curved.\nmarketing: That's gonna be double curved, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Double curve, yeah, double curve.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: One, you have.\nproject manager: Uh wood? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's yeah, a a rubber uh \nmarketing: Rather four buttons.\nproject manager: Uh do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Oh no, interface.\nproject manager: Y maybe, two? We have two special colours.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Y y yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah that's special colours, sure.\nproject manager: Push button.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah, we have four.\nindustrial designer: Five?\nuser interface: Five. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Scroll wheel. We don no.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: It it's more like integrated scor.\nindustrial designer: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel, actually.\nuser interface: No no.\nmarketing: Yeah tha that's wheel.\nindustrial designer: Y you tu you turn you turn it, so \nuser interface: No no no, it Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Scr\nproject manager: So, no button supplements?\nmarketing: I think the price is okay.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Um, no.\nproject manager: Okay we I think we have problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: L_C_ display, maybe. Interface.\nproject manager: I think we s if we keep on adding things \nindustrial designer: It's okay. fine .\nproject manager: so we have to \nmarketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells.\nproject manager: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Has it changed.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it was stage one, so.\nmarketing: No y i it did change, but\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh.\nmarketing: just imagine we have \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, but we have you the the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: no?\nmarketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really \nuser interface: Yeah it's the one it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: m maybe we ha we have two versions, the first version, the basic version.\nindustrial designer: I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.\nuser interface: Advanced version we have speak.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh it seems that this can be \nmarketing: Yeah, if \nproject manager: Or it would be better.\nindustrial designer: yeah, wood into plastic and it it should be fine.\nuser interface: Plastic is free. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Yeah, that's one of the requirement.\nproject manager: Because we have red.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, red and yellow.\nproject manager: Red and yellow.\nuser interface: Wait.\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nuser interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black.\nuser interface: yellow.\nmarketing: Black then is a regular colour, so.\nproject manager: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Yeah, one.\nproject manager: pineapple bee. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one.\nproject manager: Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button\nmarketing: Yeah, thi this might be.\nproject manager:. So we'll we have only one? And push button.\nmarketing: Close to.\nproject manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button, it's uh \nindustrial designer: One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons, so we can just, I dunno, try to modify some of them to have yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so what's the bottleneck?\nuser interface: How about we change the sale?\nmarketing: Double curved.\nindustrial designer: Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.\nproject manager: Something flat.\nindustrial designer: F some \nmarketing: Yeah, but flat \nproject manager: S uncurved. Yeah, maybe not.\nindustrial designer: Single curve .\nmarketing: Case, what's the ca\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Single curve should be fine, so. Oh, what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Nearly.\nuser interface: Ah we have one {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And then one Euro left.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Maybe don't bat no battery, only solar cells.\nindustrial designer: It's it's a bad idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one.\nindustrial designer: Two?\nproject manager: Just one.\nindustrial designer: One. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's fine. That's fine. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay. Agree.\nproject manager: So yeah, you will have \nmarketing: So we have one button,\nindustrial designer: One s one scroll wheel, so\nmarketing: one wheel.\nproject manager: So one button, and s scroll wheel with push button on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And the vocal chord, it's fine. It I th it's fine.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: It's good they're not charging anything for that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is\nuser interface: Cou could we have look \nproject manager: twelve fifty e\nuser interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost?\nmarketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half.\nproject manager: Yeah, but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal.\nindustrial designer: It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine, so \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. So let's say \nproject manager: Twelve fifty.\nuser interface: Wha what \nindustrial designer: It's fine, twelve fifty uh \nuser interface: yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Solar cells.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: The solar cells, r is i is it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's not t t\nproject manager: I think, yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, to be able to si to sell it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Cheaper.\nmarketing: That's nice argument,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, with mi\nmarketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve.\nindustrial designer: It's it is really really uh really very very expensive, though.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe if uh okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but we just have one button. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's easy to use and powerful, as the remote control a has only one button.\nmarketing: Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah.\nproject manager: Easy, powerful.\nindustrial designer: It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Uh that's what we've just done.\nindustrial designer: We've done it with it is under the if it was low, high or so.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Um okay.\nproject manager: Now \nindustrial designer: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if \nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, it's fine.\nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling?\nuser interface: Yes. Of course. This is my job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's uh it's good, to to create a control instead of a computer. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And for the marketing guy?\nmarketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: And new ideas about new products, maybe, wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know \nproject manager: Yes, just lemon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon.\nuser interface: Yeah, but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um \nindustrial designer: It's flat, uh \nuser interface: Yeah yeah it's flat,\nproject manager: Squared?\nuser interface: yeah the shape is very boring.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. It's really boring, yeah.\nuser interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can you have base, triangle base so you the T_V_ you can \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah, the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's that would be really interesting, actually.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also \nproject manager: Oh, that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device.\nindustrial designer: Device devi\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The fruit? Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe \nmarketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe la next year it will be insects.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's \nmarketing: Maybe two years it's dead.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. That's a yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for\nindustrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.\nmarketing: fifteen years \nproject manager: Customable T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you customise it every ti so every ti if people change, you just change the appearance, and y y you can keep \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Tha that would that would make it. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you can keep the global appearan\nproject manager: Yeah, and following \nindustrial designer: The mood of persons, the fashions uh \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's interesting, maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr\nindustrial designer: We int Yeah, T_V_, yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter, you know, so it's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So what i and do w is it Okay.\nproject manager: So I think the costs are within the budget. We're just at twelve fifty Euros.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the pr at \nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: do you think you can celebrate your creation?\nuser interface: And you can celebrate your leadership. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object. So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy, so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. It's party party remote control.\nproject manager: The thing now is to to sell it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's your job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Sell it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: right, go and sell it. Goo and good luck, so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh-huh. Twenty five Euros.\nuser interface: Twenty five Euros, yeah.\nindustrial designer: It should be fine.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think it's \nproject manager: It's maybe a little bit expensive. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twenty five Euros.\nmarketing: It's cheap, yeah. No, I \nuser interface: No, it's not so expensive.\nmarketing: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know.\nindustrial designer: Wh really?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It should be it should be fine, you know, actually. S\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe what you can do a test. Put it outside, and if bees come, it's really fruit. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good, so actually so \nproject manager: But don't put sugar in it, it's not working.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, the colours are uh it's perfect, yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's perfect, and \nmarketing: True. Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.\nindustrial designer: I p is th y {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but the colour, I think the colour is more is most important,\nindustrial designer: the the yellow ball thing that \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control.\nmarketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere.\nindustrial designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ \nproject manager: Yeah, but we decided to have something yellow and red, for the costs.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R_.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Okay yeah, yeah. That's actually good idea, so \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: So we have the logo, we have the colour, and we have the fashion in electronics,\nuser interface: So we have to give a \nproject manager: so we have the slogan too.\nuser interface: So we have give him give it a cute name.\nproject manager: Yeah\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: th no, it's the it's the pineapple control remote control.\nuser interface: Mush mushroom controller.\nmarketing: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend.\nproject manager: It's a pineapple now, it has changed. It's a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: It's not a mushroom. It's a pineapple remote controls.\nmarketing: It's not the trend.\nproject manager: Pineapple.\nuser interface: Pa Pine apple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, pineapple remote remote control.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just flying saucer, or \nproject manager: With cherry on top.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: I would say flying saucer.\nindustrial designer: Oh unid uh unidentified remote control, so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's more appropriate, somehow.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: That's that's pineapple remote control. I think it's fine.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Will you buy one?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah I will try I'll try {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Try to. Okay uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twenty five Euro.\nindustrial designer: . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage \nuser interface: Okay. Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_\nindustrial designer: Yeah I always lose my Yeah, so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_, so it would be \nuser interface: so you need to buy one.\nproject manager: One thing I like is the shape, because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket, on uh in your jacket.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: \nuser interface: Traditional one? Yeah. So this one and this one. What do you choose?\nproject manager: I prefer the laser remote control. No.\nindustrial designer: I think I would choose this one because of the colour. It's\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What do you choose? Okay.\nindustrial designer: it's will enlight your house, your home and your T_V_, so.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Oh. Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah that would be uh an idea.\nmarketing: Yeah but that's going to be expensive, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno.\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one, and maybe add some features to it after yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, afterwards, if\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: if it's a new trend. Okay.\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah that's that fine. So we can celebrate now. That's our new product.\nproject manager: Champagne , mister Baba. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: We should celebrate.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's it's fine. It's I like it. Next time. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So buy one. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, I'll buy one here.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay, I will close this. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No?\nproject manager: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and we have a nearly final product.\nmarketing: Our final prototype which yeah.\nindustrial designer: Final prototype, yeah, ye yeah.\nproject manager: Final prototype, right.\nuser interface: Prototype, yeah.\nproject manager: So, thank you very much.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Very productive.\nuser interface: Okay. Thanks.\nindustrial designer: S so who is going to take the remote control?"

Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: Ouch. So\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think you have nice colours. I don't {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But is it \nindustrial designer: The sha the bowl shape people like.\nuser interface: Yeah, the shape is unique, and the colour \nmarketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really \nindustrial designer: Is it really fancy?\nuser interface: So it depend on how d do you define fancy.\nmarketing: Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, and maybe do things like that \nindustrial designer: Do Don't do that, please.\nmarketing: I dunno where the lemon is, but\nindustrial designer: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like, so \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean it's not obvious.\nproject manager: It would be bet more like a lemon?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If \nindustrial designer: Because i\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Less button.\nuser interface: Uh so, my mush .\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but you don't have any button now.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: And you know, you have the finger here, with the buttons?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's uh yeah, is that \nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: that's a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's getting \nproject manager: It looks more like a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: So that's great. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sorry.\nindustrial designer: That's great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What's the use for that?\nindustrial designer: I have no idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh, for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I have no idea what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And where is the voice recognition?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh. Ah, it's embedded, your microphone.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Th this th th there's two two functions.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point.\nuser interface: This is microphone array \nmarketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: If it is fancy or not.\nproject manager: Okay. Is it better like that?\nmarketing: I mean {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Looks okay,\nindustrial designer: So we can we can say t\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: let's say it's a pineapple now. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The colour, is the colour acceptable?\nmarketing: No, the colour is okay, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: So the shape now.\nmarketing: I mean it's \nproject manager: It looks like a \nmarketing: but I would say there is more too much red.\nproject manager: now you took it.\nindustrial designer: It's too much red?\nmarketing: Um if\nindustrial designer: In the basement?\nproject manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Right. So, from one to seven?\nindustrial designer: I will give I will \nproject manager: Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum?\nindustrial designer: I'll gi\nmarketing: No, seven is false and one is true.\nindustrial designer: I'll give two or three.\nproject manager: Three, I will say three.\nindustrial designer: Three, it's okay. Three, three. Three is fine for me.\nmarketing: Three?\nuser interface: 'Kay\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Isn't it bitter like that?\nmarketing: Three.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then uh let me \nindustrial designer: What other \nmarketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative.\nindustrial designer: Is it easy to use? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an\nindustrial designer: Ye uh Embedded.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact.\nindustrial designer: It's a micro array, okay.\nuser interface: There four microphone.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay,\nuser interface: So they they they they there's a microphone array.\nproject manager: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments?\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative?\nuser interface: So you can capture voice yeah, you c\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I\nmarketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single.\nindustrial designer: W Yeah, but \nproject manager: We have tactile buttons.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I see, you have microphone array embedded. You have \nmarketing: No, that's good. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's good.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay.\nindustrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable, so \nproject manager: Maybe two?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So using the same scale, two?\nproject manager: Two? I would say two\nindustrial designer: Two, yeah, two. It's it's fine, so.\nproject manager:. You agree?\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's better like that, isn't it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now maybe the most critical one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Most \nmarketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very easy.\nindustrial designer: You just need the command.\nuser interface: You can use this in this way.\nmarketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As a principle. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Please.\nuser interface: Th this is the base.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can turn to change the channel.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\nuser interface: You just tu turn d d\nindustrial designer: I think maybe if you he\nproject manager: Oh, ok I understand.\nmarketing: Like if you want to go from \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You take take the remote, so \nindustrial designer: If you hear some click \nproject manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but imagine you y\nproject manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no, no. I if y uh if \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the \nmarketing: Yeah. I agree. I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I \nmarketing: But I mean if you're fro from two?\nuser interface: I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine,\nmarketing: So, average?\nindustrial designer: nine over three.\nuser interface: Three?\nmarketing: Three?\nproject manager: Trois. Three. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, it's .\nuser interface: Trois. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, so \nindustrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work, but it's \nmarketing: Yeah, especially on the easy to use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh s yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: target.\nindustrial designer: Might it might be fine.\nproject manager: So, th the project is accepted?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, b I think \nproject manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So uh mm mm.

So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine,\nmarketing: So, average?\nindustrial designer: nine over three.\nuser interface: Three?\nmarketing: Three?\nproject manager: Trois. Three. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, it's .\nuser interface: Trois. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, so \nindustrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work, but it's \nmarketing: Yeah, especially on the easy to use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh s yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: target."

So where's the battery battery?\nindustrial designer: The battery it is under .\nproject manager: In the base.\nindustrial designer: It is in th in in the base, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: In the basement. In the basement.\nuser interface: Base. Here?\nproject manager: And where is the solar solar cell?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar.\nproject manager: Where is the solar cell?\nindustrial designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and \nproject manager: Oh. Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price?\nuser interface: Okay\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think so,\nproject manager: Okay, we'll see after.\nindustrial designer: but it it's might be okay, so.\nproject manager: We will have first to \nindustrial designer: I it might be okay. So \nindustrial designer: That's the finance.\nproject manager: Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept, under certain conditions, the prototype, we'll have look to the final sh financial view.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm. Okay.\nproject manager: So we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet, so\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so it has the energy source. We have hand dynamo. No, we don't use that.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: We have battery, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have battery.\nproject manager: Kinetic, we don't have it, I suppose,\nindustrial designer: No,\nproject manager: but we have solar cells.\nindustrial designer: um solar cells, yeah.\nproject manager: Um, how many do y do you need, solar cells? Do you think one would be enough, or such as as number of branches?\nindustrial designer: Uh I think in each ball you have three \nproject manager: Three?\nindustrial designer: three uh yeah, three, yeah. Three three solar cells.\nproject manager: So, electronic. Single simple chip on print? Just one would be necessary?\nindustrial designer: S s simple, simple, yeah.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Zero for the others. And sample sensor, sample speaker. One?\nindustrial designer: Mm. One maybe, yeah.\nproject manager: As we have voice recognition, I think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: So the case.\nindustrial designer: Is it \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is sh it \nmarketing: So we are all already nineteen.\nindustrial designer: Wooden. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: just keep on going, just to have an idea.\nuser interface: The solar cell is too expensive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's \nproject manager: Well uh \nindustrial designer: There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think.\nproject manager: yeah, but what what about case? Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved. I think it's more like double curved.\nmarketing: That's gonna be double curved, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Double curve, yeah, double curve.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: One, you have.\nproject manager: Uh wood? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's yeah, a a rubber uh \nmarketing: Rather four buttons.\nproject manager: Uh do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Oh no, interface.\nproject manager: Y maybe, two? We have two special colours.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Y y yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah that's special colours, sure.\nproject manager: Push button.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah, we have four.\nindustrial designer: Five?\nuser interface: Five. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Scroll wheel. We don no.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: It it's more like integrated scor.\nindustrial designer: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel, actually.\nuser interface: No no.\nmarketing: Yeah tha that's wheel.\nindustrial designer: Y you tu you turn you turn it, so \nuser interface: No no no, it Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Scr\nproject manager: So, no button supplements?\nmarketing: I think the price is okay.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Um, no.\nproject manager: Okay we I think we have problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: L_C_ display, maybe. Interface.\nproject manager: I think we s if we keep on adding things \nindustrial designer: It's okay. fine .\nproject manager: so we have to \nmarketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells.\nproject manager: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Has it changed.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it was stage one, so.\nmarketing: No y i it did change, but\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh.\nmarketing: just imagine we have \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, but we have you the the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: no?\nmarketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really \nuser interface: Yeah it's the one it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: m maybe we ha we have two versions, the first version, the basic version.\nindustrial designer: I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.\nuser interface: Advanced version we have speak.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh it seems that this can be \nmarketing: Yeah, if \nproject manager: Or it would be better.\nindustrial designer: yeah, wood into plastic and it it should be fine.\nuser interface: Plastic is free. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Yeah, that's one of the requirement.\nproject manager: Because we have red.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, red and yellow.\nproject manager: Red and yellow.\nuser interface: Wait.\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nuser interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black.\nuser interface: yellow.\nmarketing: Black then is a regular colour, so.\nproject manager: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Yeah, one.\nproject manager: pineapple bee. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one.\nproject manager: Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button\nmarketing: Yeah, thi this might be.\nproject manager:. So we'll we have only one? And push button.\nmarketing: Close to.\nproject manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button, it's uh \nindustrial designer: One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons, so we can just, I dunno, try to modify some of them to have yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so what's the bottleneck?\nuser interface: How about we change the sale?\nmarketing: Double curved.\nindustrial designer: Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.\nproject manager: Something flat.\nindustrial designer: F some \nmarketing: Yeah, but flat \nproject manager: S uncurved. Yeah, maybe not.\nindustrial designer: Single curve .\nmarketing: Case, what's the ca\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Single curve should be fine, so. Oh, what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Nearly.\nuser interface: Ah we have one {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And then one Euro left.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Maybe don't bat no battery, only solar cells.\nindustrial designer: It's it's a bad idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one.\nindustrial designer: Two?\nproject manager: Just one.\nindustrial designer: One. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's fine. That's fine. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay. Agree.\nproject manager: So yeah, you will have \nmarketing: So we have one button,\nindustrial designer: One s one scroll wheel, so\nmarketing: one wheel.\nproject manager: So one button, and s scroll wheel with push button on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And the vocal chord, it's fine. It I th it's fine.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: It's good they're not charging anything for that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is\nuser interface: Cou could we have look \nproject manager: twelve fifty e\nuser interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost?\nmarketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half.\nproject manager: Yeah, but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal.\nindustrial designer: It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine, so \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. So let's say \nproject manager: Twelve fifty.\nuser interface: Wha what \nindustrial designer: It's fine, twelve fifty uh \nuser interface: yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Solar cells.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: The solar cells, r is i is it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's not t t\nproject manager: I think, yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, to be able to si to sell it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Cheaper.\nmarketing: That's nice argument,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, with mi\nmarketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve.\nindustrial designer: It's it is really really uh really very very expensive, though.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe if uh okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but we just have one button. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's easy to use and powerful, as the remote control a has only one button.\nmarketing: Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah.\nproject manager: Easy, powerful.\nindustrial designer: It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Uh that's what we've just done.\nindustrial designer: We've done it with it is under the if it was low, high or so.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Um okay.\nproject manager: Now \nindustrial designer: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if \nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, it's fine.\nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling?\nuser interface: Yes. Of course. This is my job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's uh it's good, to to create a control instead of a computer. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And for the marketing guy?\nmarketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: And new ideas about new products, maybe, wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know \nproject manager: Yes, just lemon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon.\nuser interface: Yeah, but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um \nindustrial designer: It's flat, uh \nuser interface: Yeah yeah it's flat,\nproject manager: Squared?\nuser interface: yeah the shape is very boring.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. It's really boring, yeah.\nuser interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can you have base, triangle base so you the T_V_ you can \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah, the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's that would be really interesting, actually.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also \nproject manager: Oh, that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device.\nindustrial designer: Device devi\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The fruit? Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe \nmarketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe la next year it will be insects.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's \nmarketing: Maybe two years it's dead.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. That's a yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for\nindustrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.\nmarketing: fifteen years \nproject manager: Customable T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you customise it every ti so every ti if people change, you just change the appearance, and y y you can keep \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Tha that would that would make it. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you can keep the global appearan\nproject manager: Yeah, and following \nindustrial designer: The mood of persons, the fashions uh \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's interesting, maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr\nindustrial designer: We int Yeah, T_V_, yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter, you know, so it's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.
