Can you explain the difference between a skeptic and a denier?\\n\\nSkepticism is a method of evaluating evidence and determining the validity of a claim. It involves questioning, analyzing, and critically assessing the available information before forming a conclusion. Skeptics approach claims with an open mind and examine the evidence objectively, looking for any flaws or weaknesses that might undermine the argument.\\n\\nDenial, on the other hand, is a refusal to acknowledge a belief or reality that conflicts with one's existing beliefs or worldview. Denial involves rejecting evidence or arguments that contradict a person's beliefs and ignoring or disregarding information that challenges their viewpoint.\\n\\nIn short, skepticism involves a critical evaluation of evidence, while denial involves rejecting evidence that contradicts a pre-existing belief.\",\n",
