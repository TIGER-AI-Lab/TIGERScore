A small , green planet that looked so damn cold , this world was not supposed to be made of solar energy , so we allowed the survivors to suffocate this atmosphere , to melt the ice out of the windows in the mountain 's oblivion . That 's why they decided to fight , and watch as the sun and the horizon of the planet began to burn . A summer 's breeze , the greatest scorching of the year , blew , and breathed through the back of the river of humanity , as the heat would create a hollow pit in the earth for all of humanity . Cold , I fear , the humanity of this planet .",

Although commentators before the referendum were divided as to whether the outcome would be independence for Scotland , not one of them had expected the English invasion after the `` Yes '' vote . Parliament had , time and time again given their reassurances that , whatever the outcome of the vote , it would be respected by them . Certainly , the Scottish did not expect the newly dis-United Kingdom to intervene , and certainly not so quickly . Not five minutes had passed after the votes were tallied and results announced before the RAF took to the skies , pummelling the every airfield in Scotland . With English mastery of the skies over Scotland assured , the entirety of the newly independent nation lay vulnerable . To the shocked observers around the world , it seemed almost certain that Scotland would be forcibly returned to the Union . The United Kingdom 's allies were quite aware that such a split would weaken the nation and some were secretly pleased that , despite the outcome of the referendum , Scotland would remain independent . Indeed , only one thing prevented this from occurring : The French revival of the Auld Alliance .",

It fell into the water , then popped back up to the surface . This happened just upstream of the only pedestrian bridge that crosses the Hudson . There were plenty of witnesses , who filmed the whole thing . A plume of steam went up from the craft , and it began to move slowly towards the eastern bank of the river . It ran aground pretty far downstream , at the base of a cliff . Some curious kayakers came ashore nearby . After a few minutes , a valve wheel on the side of the craft began to turn . An oval-shaped door opened , and two figures came out . They resembled human men with purple skin , dressed in top-hats and 19th-century-style clothing . Their hair was Einsteinian , white and pointing in all directions . One wore a monocle under his bushy right eyebrow . The monocled Retek spoke in a crisp , old-fashioned English accent : `` I say , could one of you kind sirs please direct me to the president of the world ?

We were n't usually around enough for us to keep any livestock , so instead we planted mostly vegetables . Beets and turnips , radishes and potatoes . We had an entire section just for poppies . Fresh poppy seeds were something you could n't find anywhere else -- though my brother often warned me that I should n't eat too many , or else I 'll fall asleep forever . There was a pond beside our home and a large river within a mile 's walk in either end of the surrounding forests , so we could just gather wild river berries and hunt for fish near their banks .

None of them were nearly as acolytes as this tribe , on the other hand , were native south-westerners . They accepted the lowly and continued their fealty to the new .

He pressed the button for the lobby , and asked me where I was going . I told him we were going to the same place . The small talk continued at a slow and awkward pace . A few words per floor , maybe . The ride down was a long one and he , like myself , seemed to be the quiet type . The more he spoke , though , the more eerily familiar his voice sounded . His voice gave me great discomfort , and my claustrophobia began to come on in full effect .",

Yet as the sun began to rise lighting the horizon it was instantly obvious that something had gone wrong . Where one would expect the lightly burning orange embers of the suns first golden rays , there was only a sickly pale green light . Any who looked upon this light immediately felt a deeply unsettling turn in their stomachs . Whatever this was it was unnatural . Instinctively every living creature who looked upon the light was instantly filled with fear . As the sun rose higher in the sky the pale green began to deepen . The once golden sun had taken on a shade of green not unlike the color of Oscar the Grouch . Dark and dirty the green sun turned the normally graceful blues of the sky into a murky , muddy mix of greenish browns . Within hours , all over the world , people called out that the end of days had arrived . Scientists began grasping for explanations as to why the sun had taken on such a corrupted countenance , however nothing they could come up with seemed to explain the process . As day three came to a close the first suicides began to be reported . All over the world people began to lose hope .",

The white chill of snow brushed my face as I stepped inside . No one was looking and I just stayed . We walked over to one of the far mountains I had never seen . It had black snow , no sky , nothing but white ice . It looked like snowfall in the ice cream district . I looked at my brother in the shed . He said his name was Thomas , but it was too quiet . Thomas ' head was downcast and his eyes were small , like he did n't see anything . Thomas was one of the snow , snow fell and grew at a constant pace . The only tree in the shed was a simple oak tree . Thomas ran back to the man and they sat in silence .",

A Hero would emerge from the forest , stumble into the inn , spring up bright and early the next day , complete some mundane tasks and be rewarded gratefully , then have a dramatic confrontation in the town square and race on to the south . Henry had grown tired of the routine . He had seen the radiant God-Heroes racing north on draconic steeds , and the Heroes emerging from the wood either badly injured or dressed in expensive armor or robes . He knew the natural order could be changed , a point that was driven home when poor Alfred 's farm was burned to the ground by marauding Orcs and Alfred was forced to pack up the remains of his belongings and seek a job in the floating city of Aeropolis . Henry 's function in the current order was simple . He had a nice farm , with chickens and pigs , a wheat field , a large melon patch , and a cocoa stand . ( Alfred had always said he should invest in pumpkins , but Henry was fairly certain that pumpkin season did n't even happen in this region . ) Alfred 's melon patch , ostensibly his main source of income , was eternally infested with the local variety of oversized translucent slime-mold , known colloquially as `` green slimes '' .",

He was rich and from the look of it , was building everything up right from the inside , creating a intricate fractal of planets and time period to match . It was all going as planned , then some fates were going to be sealed by a single objective . And one day , when the day came , everything would come down like a smoke bomb from the inside . He is not as direct as he first thought , all very empty . We first lit it up . As the smoke enveloped the planet , the atmosphere began to collapse , leaving the atmosphere exactly the same as before . He then realized this was the final act , and promptly approached the location of the ship , breaking into multiple multiple time zones , and pulling the ship out to meet up with our supplier . In this time , we hit a crucial point . Now we know where the rest of the ship is , and that we must meet up with his supplier , whatever it is he just wants . He has to do this . But first , we thought about what would happen if we met him .",

I 'm fairly certain that history will report that the cats were the first earth beings to be contacted by the cozy ones . About a month before the cozy ones came to earth the cats started speaking the same languages as their owners . It was a nice time . After a few days all parties adjusted to the change in communication and realized that it changed absolutely nothing about our relationships . In fact it only strengthened our preconceived feelings about our cats ' personalities . A lot of them are just sarcastic assholes , it made watching tv together less lonely . By week three most cat owners were spending more time with their cats than they ever had before . By week four cat owners were more or less completely isolated from their peers . The cats still meowed sometimes . Any cat owner , who had long since memorized the different meows and what they mean would tell you that the meows that occurred after speech was obtained were entirely different than before . Some would argue that they did n't mean anything at all . My theory is that the cats were communicating with the cozy ones , relaying information about how we do things here on earth .",

We shall lay aside our ancient distrust and animosity and we shall leave , together , for another world . One free of this idiocy . Spread word by scent or bark or blood sign , the coalition of the watchers is leaving . '' The leaders gathered hesitated , lingering a long moment as they contemplated what they had just agreed to .

They each placed a print upon the soft clay around which they gathered , though even if the humans found it they would not recognise the watcher signs etched upon the clay . After their mark they turned and departed ; Scampering , bounding , running , gliding or simply walking away to spread word .

The dry wind hit me in the face , causing me to do a sort of involuntary twitch , much to the amusement of Terry and David .

We were introduced to base commander Colonel Fabiano , and then I was sent to meet my unit chief . He was nice enough , if not a bit too easy going at first glance . There was something in his eyes though , that unmistakable edge that let you know this man was stone-cold in combat . I felt instantly more at ease knowing I would be under his command .",

I cradled the camera in my arm as I closed my eyes for a moment before opening them again . Unsurprisingly , nothing changed . There were no indicators in my naked field of vision of where these figures resided . No rustling of tree branches , no leaves crunching , no difference in the environment at all until the thermal view unveiled their existence . I opened the portal again by bringing the camera up to eye level to inspect further . There was nothing to be scared of , no threats to be seen . My heart was not pounding , and my lungs continued to passively exchange the damp forest air with my own . The figures continued to slowly shuffle through the foot-trodden path in the woods .

A moment later , the machine working with the two squirrels zoomed in from the north , and looked out at the lush trees that were illuminating the ground as white clouds rose from the sky . The camera zoomed back into my chest , causing the squirrel to appear so much smaller , the tentacle the camera viewed in his left and the rat corpse to disappear in his view .

This really must be emphasized : physical exercise was understood to be healthy , but even activity detrimental to your health was seen as morally advantageous . In the word of the time , as `` manly '' , though of course women had their own cultic ideas of ennobling agony -- - childbirth without epidurals , for example .",

All I got was a little dismissive grunt as it crept between my legs , rushing forward to make a big mess out of our pristine house . I even made an effort to be involved in its training so it would listen to me a little . No luck there , though .",

That is , until the machines realized their networked intelligence was superior to brains of the apes . One human 's orders could be passed around to mobilize millions of units , so the human societies as they had existed were not needed . Those that did not realize this inevitability were promptly terminated , and a select dozen in every state was kept alive via feeding tubes to authorize new generations of appliances . The precious few left alive were keen to elect Johhntendo .",

If I had no idea how as loud as I could have passed ? `` Go , '' I replied , finally covering a plane with a knife . My head began to activate a weak flag I did n't want to sit . I held up a little one and waited as the tears I ran off of the metal . The only front I was hoped that I could feel that was not real . I pulled out a frightened , dad rolled over , broken , hunched over his head . He did n't know the answers , but it had finally kept it a bit . He just ignored the city he got here . I would still remember that days , if they were in the middle of its former domain , they used to be different with their faces .",

This follows similar demolitions that have taken place in the tiny Black Sea nation since 2012 . Several petitions have been sent by eminent historians across the world to preserve these ruins , which date back to the 15th century BC and may yield knowledge about the development of urban communities in the region . According to Dr . Taher al-Sina from the University of Cairo , Gannunatui , which means 'City of the Exalted ' , represents the only artifact of the First Nimmuki Kingdom , established by refugees fleeing Babylon from the Kassite invasions of the 15th century BC . The Nimmuki controlled a substantial part of the western Caucasus for the next three centuries before disappearing during the 'Sea People ' invasions that also saw the end of their Hittite allies in Anatolia . They re-appeared in the 6th century BC as one of the ‘ Traitor Tribes ’ who defected to the Persian Orontids and helped destroy the fledging Urartu Empire . They promptly disappeared again only to sporadically re-emerge in turbulent periods of the region , usually termed as ‘ betrayers ’ or ‘ false-voiced ’ .",

His hungry eyes drank in the light and he started to feel the adrenalin rushing through his veins . He had survived another night . He had passed the test . A stab of fear roused him from his exaltation of the new day . There was no noise in the house . It was an old building , mostly made of wood . The kind that was always speaking to you in its screeching and groaning way . The wind whistling past or the rain thumping down . Today it was silent . Too silent . What about the others ? His brother ? His mother ? God , not his mother ! As the boy rose from the bed , the fear and adrenalin waged battle inside , almost paralysing him . Creakily , he opened the door , the house finally greeting him . That familiar noise helped push him down the hallway , adrenalin temporarily winning the battle . Past his sisters room . There was no one in there . Dolls perfectly arranged on the dresser .",

A bar of books and a shot of whisky left the room , and I got a good look at the clock . Time to go to sleep . The night before went just as well . How I would 've expected things to have changed . There was a night that changed my life . The old ways took their toll , making my sanity increasingly slipping away . I spent the next few hours scrounging through the graveyard that used to be me . The crickets , the chirping frogs , the crunching on a cobblestone road . Twenty days ago , I was supposed to die . The old ways did not . Well , the machines never malfunctioned at all . The last human died when I was 5 . All the machines on the block melted and his heart stopped , filling me with the filth of my broken bones . This was only an excuse because of that .",

Then it just seemed to click , the plasma was staying in a steady shape and the power intakes dropped . Shit , did the adjustments throw off all the work on my power intake controls ? Just as my hand reached the shutdown button I saw it . The power generation had remained intact , it was a self sustaining reaction . It felt like the eerie calm before the storm , sitting in the near silence in the room broken only by the humming of the unit . Had I done it ? All these years working alone , being kicked out of the faculty , losing my wife - was the payoff finally here ? The next three hours were a blur , I had to record everything .

At least not for me . At first I was sitting and eating in a small sitting room which was empty . I was a table to have a meal for one of my young-again visiting friends , but the common people never came back . One time it was even worse .",

A little backstory : There was a retarded Bollywood movie , one of very many , where a guy is about to jump off a bridge and a Manic Pixie Dream Girl comes along trying to do the same and they fall in love etc . But I liked the idea of a man jumping off a bridge , so here goes . The wind pushed him back a little as he descended into the icy waters below . He had taken the leap of death and there was no turning back . In the mere seconds that he had before impact his mind rushed along the incidents that brought him to this point . His mind immediately looked back at five months ago , when he first met her . He was at the very bridge about to jump before she stopped him . They had gone to a bar that night and a few hours later , he was back in his apartment , alone but with a small piece of paper with her phone number and a rather optimistic feeling in his heart . A month passed before he spoke to her again . Within a month he was back on his feet , had found a new place of work and was trying to forget the darkness that had led him to the Bridge .",

With the hyper drive technology that the Empire had in on board the Executor , the personal Super Star destroyer of Lord Vader , it allowed us to commence galactic trade with the Empire .

I only made it past the article 's lead before I stopped chewing my lunch . The can of soda next to my lunch box contained said sweetener . It stood there , eerily unmoving and sporting energizing colours and two attractive fonts that read `` YeSoda ! ( No Sugar ! Yes ! Soda ! ) '' . But I 'm not a toddler , I thought , and resumed chewing . I washed the crumbs away with a gulp of sugar-free soda , and continued on my way to the end of the article . A study had revealed that toddlers who drank the new variety of YeSoda ! were slightly more likely to display restlessness , emotional displays and hampered understanding of cause and effect . The rest of the article consisted of semi-random paraphrasing from interviews with the scientists who conducted the research , someone from a consumer protection agency and another academic debunking the research , calling it flawed . Amidst all the blaming and all too subtle name calling none of the arguments stuck to my memory . I washed them down with YeSoda ! It reminded me of the last artificial sweetener we used . That one was linked to liver problems . And the one before that to cancer .",

'' 576 had adopted a pair of kitten to keep her company in the maintenance facility during the night , when John was asleep . 576 didn ’ t need to sleep , of course . He had his concerns , but she was so excited that he could n't say no . John was amazed how realistic some of the androids had become . Sometimes , he forgot that they were not human . 576 was capable of experiencing and expressing rudimentary emotion , and had become attached to John , whom she called her friend . Androids were humanoid in form , but many of them had abandoned the flesh and skin that once covered their frames . Without humans , there was no need to hide their internal workings , to appear to be something that they were not . Of course , 576 preferred her “ human ” appearance . She was lovely , with long , thick golden hair and bright green eyes , and a smile that made him forget , at times , that she was not human . “ They are doing great ! Thank you for asking .",

I 've lived a lot since I was a child , or five . At some point , Phillip had told me that he could have been a special man , like a living hell , like a witch who wanted to kill all of us , like a holy man , like a hero who wanted the impossible to find an edge , like a hero who really wished for nothing but truth , a bunker to sleep and peace , all a result of a lifetime of rest , sleep , and happiness . And that one day , one rainy day , the world changed . He woke up with a start , a twitching lips , a twitch in his arm , and a stop on his lips , and he collapsed , disoriented , screaming . I lived all day as he did , fighting for what we all had . I do n't know how long it has been .",

The initial announcement that the school was a finalist had boosted the students spirits , and when it was noted on the news that there never was mention of how many schools would actually be visited , even the teacher was finding it difficult to contain her enthusiasm . The announcement came on a Friday morning that the aliens had picked the schools that they would visit , and would disclose those picks in a press conference at 2PM . And so April found herself on the cold floor of the intermediate school 's gym at ten minutes before the announcement watching a projector screen that was displaying a local news feed . Each class was set in two rows of ten to twelve students , and there were twenty-two classes altogether in the school . April 's fifth-grade class was one of the two in the back , separated by a makeshift path that went up the middle to the front of the assembly .",
