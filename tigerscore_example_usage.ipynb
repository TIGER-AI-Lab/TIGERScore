If you have lots of money, then you've got to pay the same amount to the same person.\\nError aspect 1: Accuracy\\nExplanation 1: The output incorrectly describes backwardation as a concept related to having lots of money and making payments to the same person. Backwardation is actually an economic condition where the current price is higher than the price expected to prevail in the future, which leads to a profit when the anticipated price is realized.\\nSeverity 1: Major\\nScore reduction 1: 4\\nError location 2: It's a way to make money, but it doesn't mean that you'll have to spend a bunch of money. You're not going to pay that much money back, so you don't have to worry about how much money is going to go back.\\nError aspect 2: Accuracy\\nExplanation 2: The output incorrectly suggests that backwardation is a way to make money without specifying how, which is misleading.

In reality, Wynonna Earp is a supernatural Western horror television series created by Emily Andras. The output should correctly describe the genre, creator, and source material of the series.\\nSeverity 1: Major\\nScore reduction 1: 4\\nError location 2: The film is set in the fictional town of Wynonna, New Jersey, and is set on a fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean.

It was filmed in New York City, New York, and Los Angeles, California.\\nError aspect 2: Completeness\\nExplanation 2: The output does not answer the question about where Wynonna Earp is supposed to take place. The correct answer, based on the reference, is that the series is set in the Ghost River Triangle, which is a supernatural limbo, and also in the Ghost River Mine, a supernatural gold mine, both of which are located in the Ghost River Mountains.

It is typically used to model events with more than two outcomes.\\\"\\nError aspect 1:  Misunderstanding context\\nExplanation 1:  The Bernoulli distribution is a binary distribution, which can only have two possible outcomes. It is not used for events with more than two outcomes. The correct statement should be that Bernoulli distribution is used to model events with only two possible outcomes.\\nSeverity 1: Major\\nScore reduction 1: 4.0\\nError location 2:  \\\"One such application of Bernoulli distribution is in the scenario of a dice roll.\\\"\\nError aspect 2:  Misunderstanding context\\nExplanation 2:  The Bernoulli distribution is not used to model a dice roll. A dice roll is a binomial distribution, not a Bernoulli distribution. The correct example should be a coin toss.\\nSeverity 2: Major\\nScore reduction 2: 4.0\\nError location 3:  \\\"Each time a dice is rolled, the outcome is independent and the probability of getting any number from 1 to 6 remains the same.\\\"\\nError aspect 3:  Misunderstanding context\\nExplanation 3:  This statement is incorrect because the probability of getting any number from 1 to 6 changes each time a dice is rolled due to the randomness in the process. The correct statement for a dice roll would be that the outcome is not independent and the probability of getting any number from 1 to 6 changes each time a dice is rolled.\\nSeverity 3: Major\\nScore reduction 3: 5.0\\nError location 4:  \\\"This can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution where the probability of getting any particular number is 1/6.\\\"\\nError aspect 4:  Misunderstanding context\\nExplanation 4:  This statement is incorrect because the probability of getting any particular number from 1 to 6 is not 1/6, it is 1/6 if the number is 6. The Bernoulli distribution is used to model binary events where the probability of getting a particular outcome is either 1 or 0.\\nSeverity 4: Major\\nScore reduction 4: 4.0\\nError location 5:  \\\"A dice roll has six outcomes - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\\\"\\nError aspect 5:  Misunderstanding context\\nExplanation 5:  This statement is incorrect because a dice roll has only six outcomes if the number is 6. The other numbers from 1 to 5 are not outcomes, they are numbers on the dice. The correct statement should be that a dice roll has six outcomes if the number is 6.\\nSeverity 5: Minor\\nScore reduction 5: 2.0\"\n",
